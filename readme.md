# Music-Controller

## About
This project is the result of the following course: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kCLWnGmK0jUBmGLaJxvi4j

It currently contains no additional code that I added myself. If that should change, I will update this section with the commit hash of the commit that represents the project at the end of the course, so it can be compared to the current state of the project.

## How to run (in dev/debug mode)
* in project root (same folder as manage.py): `python manage.py runserver`
* in /frontend: `npm run dev`
* access the app at 127.0.0.1
